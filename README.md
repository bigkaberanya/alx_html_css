## 📁 Project Structure


## 🖼️ Design Source

This project is based on a Figma design:

- If you haven't already, create an account on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
- Open the design project and click **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to get access.
- In case the link is inaccessible, use the local `.fig` file or request a fresh link from the team.

> **Note:** Make sure to install the required fonts for accurate visuals:

> - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
> - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/creative-ally/spin-cycle)

## 💡 Key Implementation Notes

- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile layout activated when the screen width is `480px` or below.
- ✅ **Content Width**: The content container is centered with a max width of `1000px`.
- ✅ **Hover Interactions**:
  - All `links`: `color: #FF6565` on hover/active.
  - All `buttons`: `opacity: 0.9` on hover/active.
- ✅ **Typography**: Typography follows the Figma specifications. If font substitution is required, similar system fonts are used as fallback.
- ✅ **Rounded Values**: Slight adjustments made to floating-point values for clarity and consistency.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- Figma (Design reference)
